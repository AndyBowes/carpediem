## Creation of RoboCode Tank for York Code Dojo

A chance to dust-off my RoboCode coding chops & attempt to recreate a RoboCode tank that I wrote ~8 years ago.

It's definitely work in progress and won't win many Rumbles but it illustrates a couple of interesting techniques:
* Bullet Dodging - wait for the opponent to fire before moving.
* Anti-Gravity Movement - Ride the gravity well to attempt to keep a reasonable distance from Walls & other Robots.
* Linear Targeting
* Circular Targeting
